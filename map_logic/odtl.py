"""The Open Doctrines translation layer: GD5 maps out, and back again.

Greater Diplomacy 5 and Open Doctrines describe the same kind of world and
share no file format. open-dragoman converts between them -- an MIT library
with no code from either game in it -- and this module is the whole of what
the rest of GD5 needs to know about it.

WHAT CROSSES, AND WHAT DOES NOT

Provinces, borders, owners, nations with their colours and flags, alliances
and wars, the date, and events as far as the two scripting systems overlap.

The conversion is lossy in both directions, and the losses are not the same
one way as the other. Open Doctrines has fortification and port technology GD5
does not; GD5 has manpower, fuel and faction leaders Open Doctrines does not.
Neither is invented for the other. Anything the destination game has no field
for is written to a sidecar file beside the map, and both games ignore files
they do not recognise -- so a translated map loads normally in the other game
AND comes home intact if it is translated back.

Whatever could not cross is reported, per conversion, and the screen shows it.

TWO WAYS TO REACH THE LIBRARY

On desktop it is the `open-dragoman` package from requirements.txt.

On web there is no such thing: pygbag installs pure-Python wheels and its own
prebuilt WASM ones, and open-dragoman is neither. So the browser build loads
the WASM side module shipped beside the game and declares by hand the six
calls used here. Both paths end at the same C ABI in the same library, and
abi_version() is checked either way, so a mismatch is refused rather than
guessed at.
